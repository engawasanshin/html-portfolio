<h1>The Best Movies According To Shio</h1>

<h2>My top3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>I love the importance of maintaining hope, the depiction of the scenery,
     and the changes in the relationships between the prisoners.</p>

<h3>The Martian</h3>
<p>I love how the protagonist, unintentionally left behind on Mars, kept striving by using all his wisdom to survive. And I like Matt Damon in the first place</p>

<h3>The A-Team(TV Show)</h3>
<p>I love how the A-Team, with their seemingly disparate personalities, use their individual abilities for a common goal: to take down the bad guys. The comedic elements and the resourceful weapon-making really appeal to my masculine side.</p>
